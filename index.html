                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p class='texts'>According to The World Bank about 28% of people around the world work in Agricultural sector. Africa and South Asia has more than half of its population reliant in agriculture. Subsequently, developing countries have more than one fourth of its GDP accounted by agricultural sector. Agriculture sector has played its crucial role from reducing poverty to ensuring food security by feeding billions of mouths every single day. </p>

                <h1>Problem Statement</h1> 
                <p class='texts'>There are several issues concerning the agriculture sector one of which is wastage of food crops. According to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) annually up to 40 percent of food crops are wasted due to plant diseases which costs the global economy around 220 billion dollars.   </p>
                <p class='texts'>Moreover, scientists predict that by 2050 we will have 2 billion more mouths to feed. To meet demands as such rain forests are being mercilessly destroyed only adding burden to the existing environmental stress.    </p>
                <p class='texts'>Therefore, finding ways to minimize spread of plant disease which can be implemented even by uneducated farmers around the world has become an urgent global issue. This would not only help overcome financially losses incurred globally resulting from crop diseases but also offer an alternative to deforestation.    </p>

                <h1>Our Mission</h1>
                <div style="width:700px; height: 250px; margin: auto; display: block;" class="graph"><img src="img/phone.jpg" style="width: 710px; height: 225px; display: block; margin: auto;" ></div> 

                <p class='texts'>Our objective is to train robust Computer Vision models using Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), which helps to classify plant disease. Given a plantâ€™s image, the model can help identify disease so further steps can be taken to prevent spread of the disease, which happen to be extremely contagious, among plants. This would help minimize crop wastage resulting from plant diseases.    </p>
